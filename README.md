**BMI Prediction with XGBoost, MLflow, and DAGsHub**

**Overview**

This project showcases the development of a BMI category prediction model using the XGBoost algorithm. It demonstrates the use of MLflow for experiment tracking and model management, alongside DAGsHub for collaboration and version control in a machine learning context. Through this README, we'll explore key code features, the role of MLflow and DAGsHub, and provide visual insights into the workflow.

**Project Highlights**

**XGBoost for Classification:** Utilizes the powerful XGBoost classifier to predict BMI categories based on height, weight, and gender data.

**MLflow Experiment Tracking:** Leverages MLflow to track experiments, log model parameters, and store model metrics, enhancing reproducibility and insight into model performance.

**Hyperparameter Optimization:** Demonstrates how to perform hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal model configuration.

**DAGsHub for Collaboration:** Uses DAGsHub to share the project, allowing others to view, contribute to, and replicate experiments and model training processes.

**How MLflow Powers the Project**

MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. In this project, MLflow is instrumental for several reasons:

**Tracking Experiments:** Every model run, with its parameters and metrics, is logged for comparison and analysis. This makes understanding model improvements over time straightforward.

**The Core of the Project**

At the heart of the project is the predictive model built with XGBoost. Here's a brief overview of the model training process:

**Data Preprocessing:** Includes encoding categorical variables and splitting the dataset.

**Model Training:** Involves configuring the XGBoost classifier with hyperparameters like learning rate and max depth, fitting the model to the training data, and evaluating its performance on the test set.

**Logging with MLflow:** Each training run's details, including parameters and metrics, are logged using MLflow for easy tracking and comparison.
